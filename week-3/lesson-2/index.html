						<h2>What is a framework?</h2>

						<p>
							A framework is a standardized set of concepts, practices and criteria
							for dealing with a common type of problem, which can be used as a
							reference to help us approach and resolve new problems of a similar nature.
						</p>

						<p>
							In the world of web design, to give a more straightforward definition,
							a framework is defined as a package made up of a structure of files and folders
							of standardized code (HTML, CSS, JS documents etc.) which can be used to support
							the development of websites, as a basis to start building a site.

						<h2>Materialize CSS</h2>


						<p>
							Materialize is a CSS framework based on Material Design principles with Sass support
							for better development. It carries default styling for easy use, and has detailed documentation.
						</p>

						<p>
							Google’s Material Design is aimed to work well on the Web and also on mobile apps.
							It’s gaining popularity with developers and if you want to adopt it too,
							there are many ways to implement Material Design on your site. You can use Polymer or Angular,
							or you can use Materialize.

						<h2>CSS Grids</h2>
